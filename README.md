# Firebox

This is my entry to the [Arduboy Game Jam 5](https://community.arduboy.com/t/game-jam-5-pretty-simple/9067), theme: 'Pretty Simple' for the [Arduboy miniature game console](http://arduboy.com/)

It's like a sandbox, only with fire! 

Controls:
- Hold A to increase fire
- Up + down arrows choose different objects to drop
- Left + right arrows move the object to drop
- B drops the object
